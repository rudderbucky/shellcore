Text("Truth_starprism_d3", "Well that’s kind of obvious. You must have been sent here by Heracles.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d4", "Yeah...")
Text("Truth_starprism_d5", "I was sent here by a Core called \"Heracles\"...")
Text("Truth_starprism_d6", "Of course! You were determined to not be a threat, whoever you are. I know they are cryptic, but it’s necessary to avoid scaring off newcomers.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d7", "So who are you?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d8", "I am Starprism. I work for the same cause as Heracles - we are trying to find a way to live alongside the Defected.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d9", "Why would you want to do that?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d10", "Because this has been their home since we were sent here. They may not be able to communicate with us but they deserve existence as much as we do.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d11", "Heracles said there were others out there...")
Text("Truth_starprism_d12", "Why not go back to the Standard Sectors?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d13", "Well, in truth, as I’m sure Heracles has told you and as you have understood... we are abandoned by our leaders. Writing our own story, as Heracles would put it. This is to say — I don’t think they want us back.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d14", "How can you be so sure about that?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d15", "Well we can’t really. But we have discovered the Jump Gate was created by the Red Leader. The gate emits an energy signature that matches them.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d16", "So?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d17", "So... in theory they could make a gate that sends us back. There’s nothing special about these sectors that prevent warping — in fact there are plenty of strange gates to warp around here. Good thing the defects don’t understand how to use them.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d18", "This sounds entirely made-up.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d19", "Perhaps... but as the eons pass, you’ll realize working with us is better than fighting against us because of whatever infection nonsense we were told.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d20", "So who made these other gates?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d21", "It’s bizarre... there are three distinct signatures, two of which are the Leaders themselves. And a third... nobody knows who’s behind the third.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d22", "Yes, there are. There exist two other factions. The Exterminators, and the Unconvinced.")

Text("Truth_starprism_d24", "Who are the Unconvinced?")

Text("Truth_starprism_d26", "They still believe the lies?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d27", "They’re mostly new entrants. As they face time itself, they too will begin to see our ways. They’re not doing a terrible job keeping their base protected, but a lot of them will give up and join us at Kappa eventually.")

Text("Truth_starprism_d29", "You seem interested in our cause. If you are willing to fight for us, we have a mission to win over space outside this ceasefire. Come to our hideout if you want to pursue it. I must be going now.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d30", "They seem more grounded in reality to me.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d31", "I see... well I shall depart and get out of your way then. Bear in mind, we accept all who come to our ways.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d32", "So war continues in the Abandoned Sectors.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d33", "This is true. Even this far away from the Standard Sectors, we continue to war with our fellow ShellCores. I guess... war is just part of who we are.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d34", "The Defected are merely destroying each other out of instinct. We do it voluntarily. How pathetic…")
Text("Truth_starprism_d35", "Then why take a side?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d36", "Because I know it’s the right thing to do. Our side is the one seeking peace, the others continue the barbarism of violence the leaders have ingrained in them.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d37", "I’m not sure that’s right.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d38", "Bringing up the idea of war means you’re not sure I’m right. I can’t make your own mind up for you. I shall leave now. I hope you see our ways soon.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d39", "You really think that?")
Text("Truth_starprism_d40", "I almost know this... perhaps it is a by-product of our consciousness. And perhaps we should be ready for other conscious beings to war against us — the defects... you don’t seem to appreciate this yet, but do know we still welcome those who have shunned us before.")
Text("Truth_starprism_d41", "Led by Sisyphos, the Exterminators wish to eliminate all defects from the Abandoned Sectors and create space for us to continue to survive here.")
