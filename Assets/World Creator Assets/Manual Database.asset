  - title: Introduction
    imageID: 
    contents: "Welcome to the manual! \r\n\r\nThis manual is meant to aid users through
      the process of creating worlds in the World Creator. Each entry will provide
      information about the tools, objects, and many more. Though the World Creator
      is abstract, we believe it has great power in creating stories in a ShellCore
      setting. We hope you enjoy using it!"

  - title: Read and Write Worlds
    imageID: 
    contents: "To read and write a world from your files, navigate to the bottom-left
      corner. You will find three special buttons: play (arrow), read (book), and
      write (pencil) buttons. Pressing the read or write button will open a window
      that display all of your worlds. To read a world, select one of the worlds
      and press the read world button. To write a world, select a world to override
      and press the write world button. If the world does not exist, you can add
      a new world by pressing the add item button. \r\n\r\nIf you press the play
      button, the game will switch to gameplay mode where you can playtest your world.
      Note, the game will stop you from playtesting or saving a world if it has found
      an error. "
  - title: Clear World
    imageID: 
    contents: To clear everything in the current scene, click on the button with
      the eraser icon. The game will throw a prompt before clearing the world. Make
      sure you know what you are doing.
  - title: Troubleshooting
    imageID: 
    contents: 'The likelihood of a playtester finding a bug or an error is easier
      said than done compared to world creators. The best approach is to troubleshoot
      the issue. The first option is to check the world, locate the problem, and
      try to resolve it. These are usually user-made bugs from accidental oversights
      or mistakes from the world creator. If the world creator is unable to fix the
      problem, then the issue is considered a code-related bug, which leads to the
      second option. Try to recreate the issue as much as possible and create a bug
      report.



      Some error messages are intentional, mainly to avoid certain
      user-related mistakes.'
  - title: Backups
    imageID: 
    contents: If you are ever concerned about losing your world due to bugs or errors,
      always make a backup and store it somewhere safe. The game does generate placeholder
      directories for specific files, as well as a TestWorld within the StreamingAssets
      directory. As long as the World Creator does not load another world, the game
      should retain those files.
  - title: Dev Console
    imageID: 
    contents: "This game has a built-in Developer Console. For world creators, this
      is a great tool for speeding up playtesting and troubleshooting. If the game
      finds an error in the World Creator or from playtesting, it will throw an error
      message in red. Sometimes a warning message in yellow will also show up due
      to missing inputs from certain objects. \r\n\r\nTo manually open this window,
      press the 'F3' key or the custom input from the Settings window. Press the
      key again to close it. To enter a command, input a value and press the 'Enter'
      key."
  - title: Modes
    imageID: 
    contents: You can change the World Creator's current mode by pressing the mode
      button in the bottom right or by pressing the 'Z' key. There are three main
      modes - Item Mode, Sector Mode, and Control Mode. Separate manual entries exist
      for each one.
  - title: Item Mode
    imageID: 
    contents: "Item Mode allows you to manipulate the world's items. If you don't
      know what items are, they are placeable objects on your hotbar. They come in
      various types: ground platforms, background objects, and units. They will load
      in your world if placed in a sector. You can use the middle-mouse button to
      scroll around, or press the two arrow buttons to select one of them. \r\n\r\nLeft-clicking
      will place these items down, and right-clicking will remove them. You can modify
      an item's properties (blueprint, ID, and name) using the Item Properties Window.
      To save the changes you made to an item, press the 'Enter' key. Remember, not
      every object is the same, and all objects must be inside a sector.\r\n\r\nSome
      objects can be placed on top of each other if they are from different categories.\r\n"
  - title: Sector Mode
    imageID: manual_sector_mode
    contents: "Sector Mode allows you to create and manipulate a sector's size, shape,
      and metadata (name, color, background spawns, etc.). A sector is a unique object
      that stores various items and loads them in-game. \r\n\r\nTo create a sector,
      hold the left-mouse button to create a sector. Releasing the button will create
      the sector. To adjust sector properties (or metadata), click on the sector's
      center to open the Sector Properties Window. To save the changes you made to
      an item, press the 'Enter' key. Clicking on the edge of a sector will adjust
      the size.\r\n\r\nSectors are capable of spawning entities via background spawns.
      To add a background spawn, click on the add background spawn button in the
      Sector Properties Window. To save the sector's background spawns, click on
      the parse background spawn button."
  - title: Control Mode
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Control Mode allows you to create, modify, and remove canvases, characters,
      and factions.



      The grayscaled ShellCore is the player''s spawn point.
      Clicking it in this mode will allow you to move it around, and clicking it
      again will place it. Make sure the core is in a valid sector. Otherwise, the
      game will throw an error.'
  - title: Select Mode
    imageID: 
    contents: Select Mode is a submode that allows world creators to select entities
      easily without needing to input the values. This is accessible via the Canvas
      Editor. Use your mouse and left-click on an object to grab an ID. If done correctly,
      you will be brought back to Control Mode. Holding down 'E' or 'F' will restrict
      the selection to entity IDs or flag names only. Press the 'Enter' key to cancel
      the selection.
  - title: Draw Path Mode
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Draw Path Mode is a submode that allows world creators to draw paths
      for various aircraft. This mode is accessible via the Canvas Editor''s Set
      Path Node or entity''s Set Patrol Path in the Item Properties Window. Left-click
      anywhere in the world to create the initial waypoint of a path. Left-clicking
      again to add a new waypoint. Right-click to remove a waypoint. To move a waypoint,
      move your cursor close to the position and hold the left mouse button. Releasing
      the button will update the modification. To save the path, press the ''Enter''
      key.



      A bit of a note about adding or removing waypoints. It is based
      on your cursor''s position.'
  - title: Property Display
    imageID: 
    contents: The Property Display window assigns metadata like ID or name onto items
      or sectors. The game will provide default parameters if you haven't set any
      values to them. Clicking on an item or a sector will open their corresponding
      windows.
  - title: Object Naming
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Naming any entity or sector is case sensitive. Be sure to keep it
      as unique as possible. If certain fields are left blank, the game will automatically
      fill them in.



      The important fields you must be cautious of are the
      ID field for entities and the name field for sectors. The game will throw an
      error if it detects duplicate entity IDs. As for sectors, the game will delete
      duplicate sectors with existing names whenever it tries to save a world.'
  - title: Entities
    imageID: 
    contents: Entity Objects are any item that can move, attack, interact, or take
      damage. They can come in various types, from stations and turrets to drones
      and tanks. These objects are customizable, so use any design you want!
  - title: Flags
    imageID: 
    contents: "Flags are a unique type of object in the game. They can't do anything
      by themselves, but other objects and systems can use them. Setting a unique
      name can make it a valid location for Spawn or Cutscene Nodes. Naming a Flag
      in BattleZones with platforms as 'tankpickup#' and 'tankdropoff#', where #
      is the faction ID, will allow tanks to move to those locations and allow commanders
      to pick them up and drop them off.\n\nName fields don't have to be unique like
      ID fields. They can be reused multiple times if they are outside a sector that
      also has a flag with the same name. If a sector has two flags with the same
      name, only one of them can be seen by the game. \n\nRemember, Flags are invisible
      in-game. You can only see them in the World Creator."
  - title: Platforms
    imageID: 
    contents: Platform Objects adds ground warfare to the player experience. They
      enable ground units (i.e., tanks) to move around and find the nearest enemy
      target. These objects come in various shapes and in two styles. Use these if
      you want entities to battle ground units.
  - title: Decorations
    imageID: 
    contents: Decoration Objects are items designed to decorate sectors. These objects
      can't be disabled via the Settings. So, use them wisely.
  - title: Misc. Objects
    imageID: 
    contents: "Any item not categorized from the previous four is considered a Miscellaneous
      Object. Excluding Flags, they can interact with entities and the player. Currently,
      there are only two types available: Interactables and Collectables. \r\n\r\nInteractable
      Objects are designed to assist or harm entities. One example is the Power Rock.
      It actively generates power orbs, which, upon collecting them, will heal the
      entity. It also allows entities to build constructs. There's no example of
      an Interactable Object that can harm entities.\r\n\r\nCollectable Objects are
      what their name says. If the player finds these objects, they are added to
      the player's save file and won't appear again. "
  - title: Neutral Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: Neutral Sectors are basic sectors with no special properties. Players
      can think of these zones as the early stage of a region. Depending on the progression,
      it's recommended to keep the enemy count to a minimum so that it is less threatening
      to travel.
  - title: Dark Neutral Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: Dark Neutral Sectors are a variant of the Neutral Sectors. They are
      fundamentally the same, but their use differentiates them. Assuming players
      don't know the difficulty of a sector, the color is the best bet. Adding enemies
      that are more threatening and rewarding will make players think about how they
      enter those sectors. Making it too difficult will likely force them to border
      hop, which isn't a good sign. These sectors are optional to world creation,
      but implementing them into a world will rely on the design of other Neutral
      and Dark Neutral Sectors.
  - title: Haven Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: Havens are intended to be players' safe zones. Entering one of these
      sectors will reset the player's spawn point to the current location and allow
      them to recover. It's recommended to have a few Havens around the map, in between
      Neutral and Dark Neutral Sectors. They are also good for setting players' progression,
      NPCs, and difficulty.
  - title: Capitol Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: Capitols are the better versions of Havens. Mechanically, they play
      the same and are optional to world creation. The only difference is how world
      creators use them. Capitols can serve as a means to reward players with harder
      missions and greater loot, or to direct the importance of the story.
  - title: BattleZone Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: 'BattleZones serve as a way to test the player''s skill level. The
      intended objective for these sectors is to destroy the enemy''s carrier without
      losing the player''s carrier. World creators can add more factions or commanders
      to spice up the battle. Depending on the implementation, balancing may cause
      some issues due to the progression gap. It''s recommended to find the right
      difficulty according to player progression.



      Setting up a BattleZone
      requires allied and enemy carriers, power rocks, vendors (i.e., outposts and
      bunkers), and enemy commanders. '
  - title: SiegeZone Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: 'SiegeZones tends to be the most annoying sector to work on. The objective
      for these sectors is to survive as long as possible while completing every
      wave. World Creators can increase the difficulty by adding more conditions
      (i.e., protect your base from the enemy onslaught) to them. Like BattleZones,
      SiegeZones may result in balancing issues due to the progression gap. So, it''s
      recommended to find the right difficulty according to player progression.



      Setting
      up a SiegeZone requires a wave set in the sector''s properties and flags. Adding
      power rocks, stations, vendors (i.e., outposts and bunkers), and units will
      help the player complete the sector. Creating a wave set can be found in the
      Wave Builder.'
  - title: DangerZone Sectors
    imageID: 
    contents: DangerZones, or DeadZones, are sectors designed to push players away
      from entering specific areas. They will incrementally damage them the longer
      they stay inside. It's recommended to add these sectors in areas where you
      don't want players to go. Background spawns are nice to include as long as
      they are not next to a Haven.
  - title: Search Window
    imageID: 
    contents: If you can't find a specific object in a world, you can use the Search
      Window to find it. Entering the ID, name, or JSON, and pressing the button
      will redirect you to that specific object.
  - title: Ship Builder
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Unlike building your ship in-game, the World Creator''s Ship Builder
      is more advanced. You can create a ship with any type of part and core configuration.
      Adding news parts requires you to manually create them with a specific shape,
      ability, and tier. Some may require you to include a secondary ID.



      Once
      you made a ship, don''t forget to save it with a unique name. They will be
      stored in the current world folder as a JSON file. Pressing the ''X'' key will
      allow you to change the core type.'
  - title: Wave Builder
    imageID: 
    contents: 'The Wave Builder is a unique feature of the World Creator. It can
      create and customize enemy waves for SiegeZones. Adding a wave will create
      a new blank wave. Adding a spawn will create a new spawnable object for a selected
      wave. Selecting a spawnable object will update the metadata. ''Shift-Click''
      to delete a spawnable object or wave.



      The only requirements for SiegeZones
      to run a custom wave in-game are to have a valid flag name and entity''s blueprint
      (name/JSON), and wave set ID. If one of the three is invalid, the game will
      throw an error.'
  - title: Vendor Builder
    imageID: 
    contents: The Vendor Builder is a bit different. This window allows you to create
      vendors, such as outposts and bunkers, with custom blueprints and provide a
      set of building options for players and enemy commanders to use. Currently,
      every entity blueprint is set as a ShellCore, so you will have to modify the
      JSON files to allow building other types of units.
  - title: Item/Sector Defaults
    imageID: 
    contents: Do you want to make things easier for yourself? If you are in the Item
      or Sector Mode and have to place the same object multiple times, you can modify
      an object's default parameters. This will reduce the need to open their corresponding
      property windows. You can find them on the bottom-left side of the screen.
      You can press the reset button to revert them to their original values.
  - title: Character Creator
    imageID: 
    contents: The Character Handler allows you to create special entities called
      characters in a given world. These entities can be made party members, if specified,
      and do not despawn if you leave their designated sector besides BattleZones
      and SiegeZones. They can be dynamically accessed via Canvases.
  - title: Faction Builder
    imageID: 
    contents: The Faction Builder allows you to create custom factions in a given
      world. They will require an ID number and a faction relation number (2^(faction
      ID)).
  - title: Canvas Editor
    imageID: 
    contents: "The Canvas Editor is the largest tool in the World Creator. It allows
      you to create objects called Canvases that run in the background for every
      world. There are only three types of canvases: mission, dialogue, and sector
      canvases. Separate manual entries exist for each one. \r\n\r\nLeft-click to
      move around the Canvas Editor. Right-click on a space to open a Node Creator
      window, and left-click to create a new node. Left-clicking on a node to select
      it to modify its values. Right-clicking it will give options to duplicate or
      delete the node, and left-clicking will confirm the action."
  - title: Mission Canvases
    imageID: 
    contents: "Mission Canvases are the most complex and flexible canvases, but are
      the longest to create and test in the entire game. They provide the foundations
      for building mission objectives. Mission Canvases are composed of various nodes,
      including their exclusives, Mission Nodes.\r\n\r\nAll Mission Canvases will
      require one Start Mission Node to initialize the mission and one Finish Mission
      Node to complete it. You can use Start and Finish Task Nodes to set specific
      objectives and Sector Limiter and Map Marker Nodes to mark the objective location.
      Use Checkpoint Nodes to save the player's progression. \r\n\r\nOne example
      of making a Mission Canvas can go as follows: \r\nStart Mission Node -> Start
      Task Node -> Flow/Condition Node -> Finish Task Node -> Finish Mission Node\r\n\r\nNote
      that the design of a Mission Canvas can vary depending on how the world creators
      want to design it. There can be as many tasks or a few objectives."
  - title: Dialogue Canvases
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Dialogue Canvases allow world creators to create passive interactions
      between the player and the entity. They are the most basic and simple canvases
      to learn, but they are known for being less compatible with other nodes. Dialogue
      Canvases are composed of various Dialogue Nodes, each with its own variants.



      Every
      Dialogue Canvas requires a Start Dialogue Node (with an entity''s ID) and a
      Finish Dialogue Node to start and end an interaction. Connecting a Dialogue
      Node between the two nodes will show the entity''s dialogue upon interaction
      in-game. Remember, these nodes can only be connected to other nodes of their
      type.'
  - title: Sector Canvases
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Sector Canvases are a unique type of canvas. They can run like a Dialogue
      Canvas and use conditions from a Mission Canvas. What makes them different
      is that they are activated whenever a player enters a specified sector.



      A
      Sector Canvas only needs an Enter Sector Node to initialize. Any node connected
      to it will run depending on how it was configured. '
  - title: Node Ports
    imageID: 
    contents: 'If you had examined some of the canvases, you might noticed the color
      for some ports. They represent the connection types for specific nodes. Some
      can be connected to a few things, while others are compatible with almost anything.
      You can refer to this below.


      Green -> Flow

      Yellow -> Mission

      Aqua
      -> Dialogue

      Dark Blue -> Cutscene

      Red -> Condition'
  - title: Part Index
    imageID: 
    contents: 'Every world has its own Part Index. If a sector has a ShellCore with
      a custom blueprint, the game will grab its parts and adds them to the Part
      Index. This also includes Mission Canvases with part rewards and traders. The
      game won''t add new parts to the Part Index if they were generated from an
      Add Reward Node, created by fusing/nullifying parts, spawned from a SiegeZone
      wave/Spawn Node, or stored in a sector that has part drops disabled. '
