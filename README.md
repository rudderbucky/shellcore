ShellCore Command Remastered  
Tactical Retro Combat.

ShellCore Command Remastered is a recreation of a series of Flash video games made circa 2010 by Flashbacker. It uses the Unity engine and
re-imagined textures. It also streamlines old concepts, fixes bugs, and adds many new features.

Currently, the game only supports Windows, and was tested on Windows 10. Full support for Mac and Linux is planned.

To run the newest version of the game, follow these instructions-

1) From the release page (github.com/rudderbucky/shellcore/releases) download the zip file from the latest release
2) Extract the zip file, and run the exe file called "Shellcore Command" (NOT UnityCrashHandler64.exe)
3) Click the "Play!" button in the window that pops up

To build a version of the game from the repository, you'll need to install the Unity editor. From here, the root repository folder should load in as the project, and from there simply select Build and Run from the options (under File)
